      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'In the Assets folder, there are some folders such as <b>GlobalEntitiesDependencies</b>
          and <b>SceneDependencyCache</b> which are automatically created by Entities
          packages, these folders are important because they contain the cached data
          and static data that is not created at runtime. Also, there is a folder
          called BuildSettings which contains the BuildAssets, but there is a tutorial
          called <b>How to build</b> in there there are descriptions in detail about
          how to use them.


          In the <b>Assets/Scenes</b> folder, all the
          scenes are stored, that includes Sub-Scenes which typically are associated
          with the name of the main Scene, nevertheless, the Sub-Scenes can be used
          in multiple Scenes, and the folder is only a reference for users to find
          it quickly and associate them with the Scene which is using those Sub-Scenes.
